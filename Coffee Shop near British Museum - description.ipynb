Last time I didn't really care about the restaurant or coffee place nearby the British Museum, therefore i ate all two lunch times inside the Museum.    \n   \nSince I am planning to go the the Museum again and this time I would like to experience the coffee place nearby. I would like to have better lunch and enjoy the coffee nearby and then can go back to Museum easily and faster. In this project I am going to use the Foursquare location data to find out the most closed coffee place near the British Museum. ",
